Hello world!

This is the first post on my new blog. As a Computer Science student, I plan to use this space to:

*   **Document my learning:** Writing about concepts helps solidify understanding.
*   **Share project progress:** Keep track of what I'm building.
*   **Explore CS topics:** Discuss interesting articles, papers, or technologies.

## Why Blog?

Blogging is a great way to build an online presence, practice communication skills, and connect with others in the tech community. It also serves as a personal knowledge base.

## Example Code Block

One essential feature for a CS blog is code highlighting. Jekyll uses Rouge by default, which works well with Markdown code fences:

```python
def greet(name):
  """Simple greeting function."""
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  greet("World")
```

```javascript
// Simple JavaScript example
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

sayHello('Developer');
```

Stay tuned for more technical content!
